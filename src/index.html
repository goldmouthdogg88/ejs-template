        <h3 class='paragraph-banner'>Getting Started</h3>
        <p>My website is so <strike>ugly</strike> awesome!, but you've got to start somewhere. So I wanted to create I
          guesse like a blog, about all the different tools avaialble with timelines with prices.</p>

        <p>If you want to be a developer, you'll want to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Which are really the very
          basics,
          how much of each should you learn? It doesn't take much to put together a basic static website.</p>
      </div>


      <div class='paragraph-container'>
        <h3 class='paragraph-banner'>Leveling Up</h3>

        <p>Once you have a grasp of the basics you can move onto frameworks and libraries. Just like with game consoles
          there's a big three to pick from. However you are far from limited to just these.</p>

        <ul class="library-display">
          <li class="library-items">React</li>
          <li class="library-items">Angular</li>
          <li class="library-items">Vue</li>



          <p>You can work with a framework or view library, but you'll want to get an understanding of ECMAScript2015
            and
            beyond. There are many place you can learn about es6 which will be helpful when reading modern documentation
            and
            tutorials on JavaScript.</p>

      <div class='paragraph-container'>
        <h3 class='paragraph-banner'>Web Design</h3>

        <p>Is hailed as one of the most difficult skills to learn, especially for the more terminal oriented community.
          Anyway I'm telling you its posible not that I can do it. I'm still learning like most.</p>
        <p>Once you get a nice web deisgn down there's the interactions, responding to user input. When a website or
          piece
          of software is designed well its almost unoticable, because it meets your expectations.</p>

        <p>There's so much that goes into programming. Building modern websites, luckily there have been major inovation
          in online learning. There are many options to learn how to code.</p>
